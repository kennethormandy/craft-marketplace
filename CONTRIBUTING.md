## Testing

### Setting up tests for use with Ddev

- Create a new db for testing specifically, so your main db isnâ€™t overwritten

Via https://stackoverflow.com/a/49785024/864799:

```
ddev mysql -uroot -proot
```

```
CREATE DATABASE testdb;
GRANT ALL ON testdb.* to 'db'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'db';
```

### Running tests

```
vendor/bin/codecept run --debug
```

### Installing a dependency

The Marketplace repo is likely set up as a folder inside a Craft CMS site, and required in your `composer.json` using the `repositories` property [as described in the Craft CMS docs](https://craftcms.com/docs/3.x/extend/plugin-guide.html#path-repository). In this case, if you need to require a new dependency for Marketplace, or change anything else in the `composer.json` file, you need to remove and re-require it before those changes to take effect:

```
cd ../

# Now in parent Craft CMS project
composer remove kennethormandy/craft-marketplace
composer require kennethormandy/craft-marketplace
```
